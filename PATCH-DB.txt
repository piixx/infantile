# PUBLIC PATCH DB FOR INFANTILE
# LAST UPDATED 9/29/2017 piixx

> Patch ID INF-0001
> crash-sandbox-A
> Fixed by Commit [ ]
> Details:
>> trying to launch a program w/o arguments causes crash
>> needs to be patched because running direct executables is not possible and hurts fuctionality
>> "isn't this a free-crash sandbox"
>> yes, but this is necessary for any programs that do not take arguments to run
>> also is not *technically* handling an exception ;)
> END
