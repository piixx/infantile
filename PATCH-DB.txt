> Patch ID INF-0001
> crash-sandbox-A
> Fixed by Commit [ 3c9a22243eacbc65847a25432d3a6148c778c14d ]
> Details:
>> trying to launch a program w/o arguments causes crash
>> needs to be patched because running direct executables is not possible and hurts fuctionality
>> "isn't this a free-crash sandbox"
>> yes, but this is necessary for any programs that do not take arguments to run
>> also is not *technically* handling an exception ;)
> END
