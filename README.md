*all* the newborn programs go here. ***all*** of them.  
that being said, there's not really much to say.  
if things are buggy, so be it. please do not submit issues on bugs here, unless  
they are security oriented, and only post those if they are *not* a sandbox.  

here, we are relaxed because none of these are serious projects unless they are marked with  
a *special symbol* you'll see later.

in the commit changelogs, you'll see these cool symbols:  

`>>`  
`>`  
[PS]  
[BETA]  
[ALPHA]  
[S2E]  

`>>` is just a simple sign that is equivalent to a subheader.  
`>` is just a comment or information under that subheader.  
[PS] means potentially serious and could evolve into a serious program later.  
[BETA] means a serious program that will continue to be developed.  
[ALPHA] means a serious program that *might* continue to be developed.  
[S2E] means it's about to move on.  

not much else, except for this:  

`CURRENT DEVELOPMENT STATUS:`      
[100] SOMETHING IS HAPPENING [100]
